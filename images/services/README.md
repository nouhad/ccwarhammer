## Replacing Images:

To use your own images:
1. Replace the existing .png files with your own images
2. Use the same filenames (character.png, weapons.png, props.png)
3. Recommended format: PNG or JPG
4. Keep file sizes reasonable (under 500KB per image)
5. Images will be displayed with an overlay, so they don't need to be too bright

## Note:
The current placeholder images are simple solid colors. Replace them with your actual service images for the best visual impact.
