# Game Titles Images

This directory contains placeholder images for the "Game Titles We've Worked On" section.

## Replacing Placeholder Images

To add your own game title images:

1. Replace `title1.png` through `title8.png` with your own game cover images
2. **Recommended dimensions**: 300x400 pixels (portrait format, like game covers)
3. **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, WebP
4. Keep the same filenames or update the references in `index.html`

The game titles grid displays 8 items in a 4x2 layout on desktop, adapting to a 3-column layout on tablets and single column on mobile devices.
